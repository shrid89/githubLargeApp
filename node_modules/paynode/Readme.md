# paynode
Paynode is the new superset payment gateway module that will provide nodejs
adapters for various payment gateways. 

This is all a rapid rework of my exisiting paypal-payflowpro module so expect
some API changes to happen quite rapidly.


## Supported Gateways
 * Paypal Payflow Pro
 * Authorize.net (AIM only)
 * Braintree
 * Chargify
 * more to come!

## Installation
This has been published as an npm package, meaning there are two ways of
installing. One is by cloning the git repo and installing it, the other is by
installing it via npm
  
      npm install paynode

## Documentation
Take a look in the docs directory for example usage for specific submodules.
